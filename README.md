# Angular Pikaday Directive

This directive lets you use Pikaday as an Angular directive.

**Note:** To use this fork,
- for `npm` or `yarn` add this to your `package.json` dependencies:

    ```
    "angular-pikaday-directive": "HornsAndHooves/angular-pikaday-directive"
    ```

- for `bower` add this to your `bower.json` dependencies:

    ```
    "angular-pikaday-directive": "HornsAndHooves/angular-pikaday-directive#0.0.2"
    ```

It will allow you to use the `v1.4.x` series of `pikaday`.
